# Why program in TypeScript

In addition to the JavaScript set, TypeScript also supports
static typing, whereas JavaScript supports only dynamic typing.
Here, the word “typing” refers to assigning types to program
variables.

In TypeScript, if you declare a variable
as a string, trying to assign a numeric value to it will result in a compile-time error.

```
let customerId: string;
customerId = 123; // compile-time error
```

TypeScript follows the latest specifications of ECMAScript and adds to them types,
interfaces, decorators, class member variables (fields), generics, enums, the keywords
public, protected, and private, and more.
